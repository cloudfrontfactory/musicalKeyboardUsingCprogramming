Musical Keyboard using C Programming - 2008 - Sreevision Fest Project

Throwback to my Bachelor's Degree 🎓 project on the "Musical Keyboard" using C programming, a project close to my heart, Alongside my talented friend Aslam.
This project not only taught us technical skills but also teamwork, perseverance, and the joy of sharing our passion with others. 

It's amazing how a simple project can leave a lasting impact on your journey.

As I look back on those days, I'm grateful for the opportunities to showcase our creation and for the memories we created together. 🌟
